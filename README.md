# omegamappin

This project has two main objectives:
- Use the FOOF method to quantify oscillations across the cortex in MEG data. 
- Compare the electrophysiology maps with other data types. 

Data:
- Electrophysiology (MEG from OMEGA & HCP)
- Functional (Neurosynth)
- Genetic (Allen Brain Atlas)
- Structural (HCP Data): collaboration with Verstynen Lab
