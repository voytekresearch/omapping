# omegamappin

This project has two main objectives:
- Use the FOOF method to quantify oscillations across the cortex in MEG data. 
- Compare the electrophysiology maps with other data types. 

Code:
- preprocessing: Scripts to process MEG data. Main Developer: Priya
- om: Custom python code to run and analyze MEG-FOOF, and compare to other datasets. Main Developer: Tom
- Torben: Some notebooks developed by Torben to look at MEG-FOOF data. Main Developer: Torben

Data:
- Electrophysiology (MEG from OMEGA & HCP)
- Functional (Neurosynth)
- Genetic (Allen Brain Atlas)
- Structural (HCP Data): collaboration with Verstynen Lab
