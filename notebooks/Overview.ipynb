    "## Notes on Heritability in OM project\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually quite a big history of studying heritability of oscillations, almost exclusively done in EEG (see AB, and in particular Anokhin 2014 review).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, the report that oscillations are heritable (with twin data) is a nice replication, but not much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Things we should focus on / leverage to build on prior work:\n",
    "- FOOF benefits: \n",
    "\t- We can isolate actual oscillatory activity, and separate out background process\n",
    "\t\t- It might be interesting to look into the heritability of PSD-slope (this would be totally novel AFAIK)\n",
    "\t- We can do a better job parsing out different parameters of oscillations (CF, power, bandwidth)\n",
    "\t\t- We might want to try an analysis investigating whether there are shared of different genetic underpinnings within and between parameters of different bands\n",
    "- MEG benefits:\n",
    "\t- Spatial analyses. We can investigate oscillatory band topographies as a parameter that has not been able to be investigated before. \n",
    "\t- We can also claim some superiority in so far as we have fewer confounds, in that differences can not stem from differences in skull/skin electrical permeability\n",
    "- Tie in with association analysis\n",
    "    - Given we are also pursuing genetic association analyses, we could try to tie heritability & association stuff together, which I think would be pretty novel\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "- As far as I can tell the HCP themselves have not done anything with MEG twin data, nor has anyone else published on it specifically.\n",
    "\t- In some ways, this is a pretty ‘low-hanging-fruit’ analysis, and we might not want to sit on it for too long\n",
    "- Sample size: some previous studies with EEG are massive (hundreds of subjects), so with ~20 pairs per twin group, we are really good numbers for MEG, but relatively small for heritability studies. "
